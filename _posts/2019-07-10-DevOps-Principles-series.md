title: "DevOps Principles"

I have started recording a series of video's explaining some of the principles and sayings I use when we talk about DevOps. There are teams that I meet that have no idea what DevOps is and why we are doing some of these things for it. I've found myself referencing something like 'Shift Left' and then having to explain it to the teams and their management that I am helping with something that for me, is related to something in the DevOps culture.  

I also want share that information with the rest of the team members that weren't there at that time. So for these cases, I thought it would be nice to have a set of small video's available that I can share and explain those things to everyone.

Creating these video's helps me getting a little more comfortable speaking to an audience, even if it is through a camera lens and with the ability to stop and do it again üòÑ. It also helps that I have some time to think through the message I'm trying to explain to the team. From there I am trying to get my intonation and articulation under control. This stuff is all new to me, so I am figuring this all out live on the job. I'm learning tons of stuff I didn't really think about before. This will be explained below. Somehow I like to challenge myself and do this stuff out in the open üòÅ.

## Setup
Let's start with the basic setup. As I am trying to find out how this all works and where to go next, I am using the hard- and software I have available. As a laptop I happen to have a Dell XPS 15. The XPS range has a couple of issues in their design. The biggest one relevant to this post is the position of the webcam. Apparently the good people at Dell found the slim bezel on the top and sides of the screen more important than the actual usability. So up the nose shots it will be, unless you try to overcome that.

## Software
I've tried a couple of different software downloads that are freely available, for example with a trial version. I know a couple of colleagues use [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com) for this stuff, but I am not ready to commit to a ‚Ç¨ 260+ purchase for a small series of video's. Surely there must be something available that is sufficient for my objectives?

Windows 10 already has some options build in, like the default camera application. Unfortunately that will not let you record  the screen as well, so only audio and the video through your webcam. What I want to achieve, is a PowerPoint presentation, with audio and my webcam in the lower right corner, taking about the subject at hand.

I once came across [Soapbox](https://wistia.com/soapbox), a Chrome plugin that can record the screen and impose your webcam video on top of it. This seemed like a nice solution, except that I found out that you need to pay to export the video! My goal is to create a playlist of all the video's on my YouTube account and then share the video's as needed. I am all for paying for the product if it adds value, yet I find that I am not ready to commit to anything yet. 

## PowerPoint!
Finally I came across a blog post that had a top 10 of video tools on Windows and it mentioned that PowerPoint has some functionality built in to record yourself while giving a presentation. This is to help the presenter with their timings, articulation and other things they need to see while rehearsing the presentation. Sounds like a good option, so I went ahead with it!

## Height
Trying to prevent the weird shots, I've been testing with different setups. The goal is to find a setup where the camera is around my eye level and where I can sit comfortably talking over a presentation.

Next up is trying out to record the videos while trying to look AT the camera.

## Playlist:

You can find the entire playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEB9h8mU8rY&list=PLXVVwOM8uv2wQyhQ7mB_Nv_iXyMuXf-GT).  
Some of the topics explained are:
* What is DevOps?
* If it hurts, do it more often
* T-Shaped engineers
* Shift Left
I try to keep them as short as possible.
