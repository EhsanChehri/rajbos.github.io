Plugin for Visual Studio (and other editors) to log hours spend in the editor. Free account only retains the information for a couple of weeks and gives you an overview of time per project/solution and per language. Really neat to see those stats. 

Currently I have this extension installed on both my laptop, pc and in a VM designated for SharePoint development.
